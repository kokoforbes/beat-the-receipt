          <p>
            Paper receipts contain the same chemicals used in single-use plastic, making them impossible to recycle.
            They're also an incredible drain on our natural resources.

              For
              context, that’s five times all the trees in New York or 4 times all the trees in Singapore – only in one
              year. Trees are vital to our planet: they provide us with oxygen, trap dust and pollution from the

              But most importantly, they help us to combat global warming by trapping excess carbon in their wood. If we

              More than half of all receipts are estimated to contain toxic chemicals called bisphenol A (BPA) or
              bisphenol S (BPS) – the same chemicals that are found in single-use plastics and make receipts almost
              impossible to recycle because these chemicals contaminate other recycled products during the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we touch receipts with our hands, the chemical coating is absorbed into our bodies in seconds and
              studies have suggested it may act as an endocrine disruptor, causing developmental and reproductive issues

              It’s estimated that 18 billion litres of water are used to produce the thermal paper used to print
              receipts every year – that’s enough drinking water for more than 25 million people for an entire year.

            <p>
              But it’s not just the water consumption that’s problematic: studies show that BPA from receipts is also

              Over 90% of receipts are lost, damaged, or thrown away by consumers, creating more 10,000+ tonnes of paper
              waste. Biodegradable waste, such as paper, makes up a considerable portion of landfills – this kind of
              waste is extremely damaging to the environment because it releases a potent greenhouse gas called methane
              as it decomposes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attempts to recycle thermal receipts rather than binning them is also very problematic – thermal paper
              recycling has been identified as a major source of BPA contamination in the creation of recycled paper
              products like toilet paper, and is a major source of BPA release to surface waters.

    <div class="wrapper">
      <details>
        <summary>What is Ditch the Receipt?</summary>
        <p>
          There's currently a massive push, driven by consumers, for businesses to be more sustainable. Paper receipts
          are non-recyclable, consume trees, oil, and water, and they don’t fit into the digital lifestyle that we
          currently have. The Ditch the Receipt campaign seeks to raise awareness about the detrimental impact of paper
          receipts on our environment.
          The main goals of the campaign are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            To educate the public and increase awareness of the harmful nature of paper receipts
          </li>
          <li>
            To encourage retailers to take a proactive approach by making paper receipts optional
          </li>
          <li>To advocate for consumer rights and work with consumer interest groups to provide customers with digital
            alternatives to paper receipts</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the Paperless Pledge?</summary>
        <p>The Paperless Pledge is a commitment from retailers to make the printing of paper receipts optional.
          Currently, most POS systems will automatically print a paper receipt, regardless of whether the customer wants
          or needs one. Some forward-thinking companies have already started on the journey to becoming paperless, but
          this process isn’t formalised yet so we’re campaigning to make sure it becomes the standard. It's our
          ambitious goal that from 2023 paper receipts will be opt-in, rather than opt-out in all major retail stores in
          Singapore and Southeast Asia.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why are paper receipts bad for the environment?</summary>
        <p>
          Globally, we print over 300 billion receipts every year and 90% of them are lost, damaged, or
          thrown away by consumers. These receipts have substantial climate change impacts across their lifecycle – from
          sourcing raw materials, such as trees, oil, and water; during their production and transport, through to their
          end-of-life disposal.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paper receipts can't be recycled because they contain toxic chemicals that leach out and contaminate other
          products during the recycling process, so the majority end up in landfills, where they release harmful
          greenhouse gases into the environment as they decompose.
          When you combine this with the tremendous amount of natural resources required to make and transport these
          receipts, the scale of the problem becomes clear: paper receipts are the hidden problem damaging our
          environment.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What's the carbon footprint of my paper receipt?</summary>
        <p>
          According to a study by Carbon Trust (commissioned by Flux), an average-sized paper emits around 2.5g of
          carbon during its lifetime – from production, to transport, to landfill.
        </p>
        <p>
          With around 300 billion receipts printed each year worldwide, that’s a whopping 750,000 tonnes of CO2e
          entering our atmosphere every year. That’s the same level of emissions as flying from Singapore to New York
          over 1,000,000 times or burning 400,000 tons of coal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Saying no to paper receipts at the till is one of the quickest and easiest ways to reduce your carbon
          footprint.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How did you calculate the carbon emissions of a paper receipt?</summary>
        <p>
          In order to calculate cradle to grave emissions of an average paper receipt, the Carbon Trust made assumptions
          on type and size of paper receipts. The following assumptions were made:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Most common type of paper used in receipts was Thermal Paper
          </li>

          <li>
            Thermal Paper Receipts average size and weight was calculated based on industry averages.
          </li>

          <li>
            Receipts are on average 9 inches in length and 3.125 inches wide
          </li>

          <li>
            Three sizes were estimated based on an average grams per square meter of 50, 58 and 65 g/m2
          </li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          The paper receipt calculation included emission from the paper production process,
          material transport, printing emissions (average electricity consumption and assumption
          of heat-based printing therefore no ink) and finally the end of life treatment of receipts.

          For receipts that end up in landfill (which is almost all of them, as they can't safely be recycled) the
          cradle-to-grave emissions were found to be 2.5g CO2e.

        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What is BPA/BPS?</summary>
        <p>
          Bisphenol A and Bisphenol S (BPA and BPS) are industrial chemicals that are commonly used in the manufacture
          of plastics. Bisphenols are present in everyday household items like food containers and plastic water
          bottles, and research has shown that these chemicals can leach from the plastic into food and beverages stored
          inside.
        </p>

        <p>
          These same chemicals are also used in the production of thermal receipt paper, and it's estimated that over
          half of the receipts contain either BPA or BPS. When we touch receipts with our hands, the chemical coating is
          absorbed into our bodies in seconds and studies have suggested it may act as an endocrine disruptor, causing
          developmental and reproductive issues. In addition to this, the presence of BPA and BPS in receipts means that
          they are unable to be recycled because these chemicals leach into wastewater during the recycling process and
          contaminate other newly created paper items, such as tissues and toilet paper. There's also evidence that
          these chemicals make their way into the
          natural environment, contaminating water and soil and causing hormone disruptions in natural wildlife.
        </p>
      </details>

        <summary>How can I take action?</summary>
        <p>There are a number of ways you can support our campaign, including:</p>

      <details>
        <summary>What’s the relationship between Ditch the Receipt and <a href="https:getbreeze.co/"> Breeze </a>?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Ditch the Receipt is a campaign group started by <a href="https:getbreeze.co/"> Breeze </a> in 2021 to educate
          the public
          and encourage retailers to be more sustainable with regards to paper receipts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Ditch the Receipt campaign does not push for digital alternatives to paper receipts.
          Instead, the sole aim is to reduce the number of paper receipts being printed unnecessarily.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What if I still need a paper receipt?</summary>
        <p>
          While we are ambitious, we want to encourage a reasonable transition towards digital receipts. Optional
          printing doesn't mean an end to paper receipts – it just means that we'll only be printing them if we really
          need them.
